## Important
KernelOS is carefully configured and tuned to achieve such stability, while maintaining such excellent and clear performance, without sacrificing compatibility.

Some things are very specific and tied only to your system, like drivers, BIOS, hardware, etc. Things like this just can't be pre-tuned for you, it's impossible to do that and still maintain that universal and highly compatible approach.

However, this does not mean that you cannot modify these things yourself. KernelOS ISOs are very capable on their own, but if you want an absolutely optimal experience, I recommend following and applying the following pre-installation and post-installation guide on your system.

You will get better FPS, lower stable time frames, better input and latency
